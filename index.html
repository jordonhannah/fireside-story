    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>When Jon Snow emerged from the woods...</p>
    <p>The wind howled through the trees, bringing with it a menacing chill...</p>
    <p>A <em>shiver</em> ran up his spine as he set fire to Godwood</p>
    <p>The crackling fire rose to a roar, masking the thud of hooves approaching from the east.</p>
